# C Daemon Boilerplate

This repository contains boilerplate C code for creating a service in a Unix
system. Find the source code here: [daemon.c](./daemon.c)

This repository will also have a basic [systemd unit](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files)
to automate the startup and keep the service up. I will add some basic
explanation on how to configure both (the daemon and system unit).
